Genome Overview 
###############

This page provide multiple data about your organism:

* Starting with general data (Gram, Taxonomy, genome length ...).
* Then the GTDBtk taxonomy classification is displayed along with the method used. 
* `CheckM <https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM/wiki>`_ and `CheckM2 <https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2>`_ analysis results are presented, to assess the quality of microbial genomes in terms of completeness and contamination. [1]_ [2]_.
* And some general statistical data about a replicon, such as: Length, GC%, Ribosomal RNAs, tRNAs types, Annotations Status, Average CDS length, Repeated regions, Average intergenic length , Protein coding density, Scaffolds/Contigs numbers, etc.
