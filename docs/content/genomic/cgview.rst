How to use the Circular Genome View?
------------------------------------

This tool is based on **CGView** (see :ref:`cgview`).

When you select the **Circular Genome View** functionality you obtain a global circular map of the selected sequence. Circles display (from the outside):

# Gene GC percent deviation (gene GC% - genome mean GC%).
# Predicted CDSs transcribed in the clockwise direction.
# Predicted CDSs transcribed in the counterclockwise direction.
# Gene GC skew (G-C/G+C).
# rRNA (blue), tRNA (green), misc_RNA (orange), transposable elements (chocolate) and pseudogenes (yellow).


Genes displayed in (2) and (3) are color-coded according different categories:

* red and blue, MaGe validated annotations ;
* orange: MicroScope automatic annotation with a reference genome ;
* purple: Primary / Automatic annotations.
